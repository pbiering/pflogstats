ToDo of pflogstats

Short term:
-----------
- Move support of customer domains to a new module (dual used by accounting and accpopimap)
   Usage with regexp
- TCP/IP-Overhead for IPv6 (done?)
- Add support of "show_user_list" for "uce" and "av"


Middle term:
------------
- Clean-up code
- Extend "range" option to support dedicated dates
- Check all used options
- Review all txttable-Output for redundant code and similar design
- Accounting: show deferred messages on end of log (still waiting for accouting)


Long term:
----------
- Accounting: store information about deferred messages on end of log (still waiting for accouting)
  for use on next run (e.g. one month later), also add an import capability of this data
# use "use strict" in main program (this means all pflogsumm code has to be reviewed)


Unsorted:
---------
* Check whether all countable data is accounted
* Proper implementation of debug mode

....many more


Done:
-----
- Remove all hash usage like "%hash->{firstindex}"
  -> done

- Decission whether to drop all old pflogsumm statistics code or move it into a module
  -> done (200504)

- Implement caching in "pflogstats-extensions-networking.pm" 
  -> done

- Make printing statistics optional
  -> done

- Make code Perl 5.0 compatible
  -> done

- Check scaling on big log files
  -> memory optimization implemented for accounting (20030205)
  -> reviewed and minor accounting differences fixed (cloning code problem)

- Accounting: filter out "bounced" and "reject" messages earlier (on aquiring statistics)
  -> done (20030207) on rewriting loglineparser

- Make information retrieving independed from old pflogsumm code
  -> partially done (20030207): accounting+uce are now well-done

- Make reject information retrieving independed from old pflogsumm code
  -> done (20030208): statistcs-reject is now well-done
